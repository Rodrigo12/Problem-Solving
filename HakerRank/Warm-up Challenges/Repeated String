Problem:
Lilah has a string, s, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.
Given an integer, n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of Lilah's infinite string.
For example, if the string s='abcac' and n=10, the substring we consider is abcacabcac, the first 10 characters of her infinite string. There are 4 occurrences of a in the substring.

Function Description
Complete the repeatedString function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the number of occurrences of a in the prefix of length n in the infinitely repeating string.

repeatedString has the following parameter(s):
s: a string to repeat
n: the number of characters to consider

Input Format
The first line contains a single string, s.
The second line contains an integer, n.

Constraints
1 <= |s| <= 100
1 <= n <= n<=10^12
For 25% of the test cases, n<=10^6.

Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the number of letter a's in the first  letters of the infinite string created by repeating  infinitely many times.

Sample Input 0
aba
10

Sample Output 0
7

Explanation 0
The first n=10 letters of the infinite string are abaabaabaa. Because there are 7 a's, we print 7 on a new line.

Sample Input 1
a
1000000000000

Sample Output 1
1000000000000
Explanation 1

Because all of the first 1000000000000 letters of the infinite string are a, we print 1000000000000 on a new line.

Solution:

// Complete the repeatedString function below.
    static long repeatedString(String s, long n) {
        //Count the number of 'a' on s
        long numberOfAs = countChar('a', s);
        //Get how many time the string will repeat itself (ex: s = aab and n = 10 then stringMultiplier = 10/3 = 3 -> '(aab)*3')
        long stringMultiplier = n / s.length();
        //Get how many extra chars should we add to string (ex: s = aab and n = 10 then extraCharsSize = 10%3 = 1 -> 'a')
        int extraCharsSize = (int) (n % s.length());
        //Return the number of 'a's found on string times the number the string repeats itself plus the number of 'a's on the substring generated by the extra chars (ex: s = aab and n = 10 then 2*3+1 = 7)
        return numberOfAs*stringMultiplier + countChar('a', s.substring(0, extraCharsSize));
    }

    //Count number of times a char appear on string
    static long countChar(char c, String s){
        long charCounter = 0;
        for(int index = 0; index < s.length(); index++){
            charCounter += (s.charAt(index) == c) ? 1 : 0;
        }
        return charCounter;
    }
